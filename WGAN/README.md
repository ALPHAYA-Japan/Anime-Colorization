### Problems to be considered

Notice that the result of WGAN is not satisfying compared to GAN result.
I believe this comparably unsatisfying result is caused by the difficulty of hyperparametrizing weight clipping value.
Thus, I'm planning to apply WGAN-GP (gradient-penalty) method to improve the result.
